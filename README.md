**8086 Assembly 8-bit Calculator**

This project implements an interactive 8-bit calculator using 8086 assembly language. It demonstrates core low-level programming concepts including register manipulation, DOS interrupt handling, and binary/hexadecimal conversion. Designed for DOS environments (such as DOSBox), the calculator performs arithmetic, logical, and number system operations through a simple menu-driven interface.

**Features**

- Arithmetic Operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (integer)
- Logical Operations:
  - AND
  - OR
  - XOR
- Number System Conversions:
  - Decimal to Binary
  - Decimal to Hexadecimal
- Menu-driven interface using DOS interrupts
- Graceful error handling for invalid input

**Technologies Used**

- 8086 Assembly Language
- DOS interrupts (INT 21h, INT 16h)
- Turbo Assembler (TASM) or MASM
- EMU8086 emulator for execution
